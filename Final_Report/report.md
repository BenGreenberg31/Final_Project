# Network Newts Final Project Report: Milestone 3
Date: May 14, 2024

##### Grading rubric

* Report includes project topic summary and research questions. 
* Report addresses research questions.
* Report is well-organized and includes few typos/grammatical errors
* Report includes code snippets, and Github repo includes all code, data, and resources used in project.
* Repo Python scripts (not Notebooks) are well-documented (have comments and ReadMes). Code is modular (uses separate files/functions) and reusable (no hard-coding). 
* Presentation slides are well-organized and include images and code snippets to assist illustration and explanations.
* Presenters effectively communicated their solution to class

Answer all:
1. What is the distribution of entities in the director-crew dataset:
  * Number of featured movies? 
  * Number of directors, number movies per director, and average number of movies per director?
  * Number of crews?
  * Number of roles and frequency of each role?
2. How will you characterize the film-director network? What are the properties (degree dist., average shortest path length, triangles aka clustering coefficient, density/sparcity)?

Pick two questions:
1. Investigate and quantify how directors have influenced the careers of crew members. Clue: consider mapping the careers of crew members over time and see if they experienced significant success after working with a particular director. What directors have had the most influence on crew members?
2. Measure how roles of crew members fluctuate
3. How widespread is the phenomenon of directors re-using the same crew? Do renowned directors (and women/minority directors) tend to work persistently with the same key collaborators compared to lesser recognized directors or a [random Hollywood director](100_rand_hollywood_dir.txt)? 


## Data Collection: Tiffany

## Network Generation: Becca

## Visualization: Katie

## Analysis: Ben
To answer the first questions relating to what is the distribution of entities in the director-crew dataset I wrote a simple script which can be found in the statistic_check.py file within the final_report folder. The results that it yielded are shown below

1.What is the distribution of entities in the director-crew dataset:
* Number of featured movies?
* Number of directors, number movies per director, and average number of movies per director?
* Number of crews?
* Number of roles and frequency of each role?


## Research Questions/Tasks

* Analyses was provided to understand the composition of dataset
* Analyses was provided to address relevant research questions
* Analysis is sound and code provided for computing metrics. Documented (comments and Readmes) Python scripts (not Notebooks) were used. Code is modular (uses separate files/functions) and reusable (no hard-coding). 
* Report includes problem summary/questions, code snippets, and is clearly written: well-organized and includes few typos/grammatical errors
