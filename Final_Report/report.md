# Network Newts Final Project Report: Milestone 3
Date: May 14, 2024

## Research Questions/Tasks

Answer all:
1. What is the distribution of entities in the director-crew dataset:
  * Number of featured movies? 
  * Number of directors, number movies per director, and average number of movies per director?
  * Number of crews?
  * Number of roles and frequency of each role?
2. How will you characterize the film-director network? What are the properties (degree dist., average shortest path length, triangles aka clustering coefficient, density/sparcity)?

Pick two questions:
1. Investigate and quantify how directors have influenced the careers of crew members. Clue: consider mapping the careers of crew members over time and see if they experienced significant success after working with a particular director. What directors have had the most influence on crew members?
2. Measure how roles of crew members fluctuate
3. How widespread is the phenomenon of directors re-using the same crew? Do renowned directors (and women/minority directors) tend to work persistently with the same key collaborators compared to lesser recognized directors or a [random Hollywood director](100_rand_hollywood_dir.txt)?
